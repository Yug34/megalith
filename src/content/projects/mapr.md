# .mapr

Essentially a light clone of Miro. I made this because Miro itself does not support adding videos to it directly.

I wanted to add videos to my mind maps, so I made this!

## Features

- .mapr supports displaying images, audio, video & PDF files.
- Everything is stored in IndexedDB for persistence.
- ^ So no account/sign-up needed for persistence (unless you switch browsers).
- **Node interactions:**
  - Delete nodes
  - Connect nodes through edges
  - Duplicate nodes
- **Canvas interactions:**
  - Pan around canvas
  - Zoom in/out of canvas
- Create multiple tabs in the canvas, switch tabs.

## Tech Stack
