# WASM-based Video editor

Was getting boring converting videos from one format/codec to another, trimming video, etc.

So I made a video editor to have a reliable UI-based editor to do such handy edits.

## Features

- Transcode or convert video to other codecs/formats
- Trim video
- Mute video
- Greyscale video
- Download edited video
