  My experience navigating my own avoidance, feeling distant from my own origins, reclaiming my name and identity.

```bazaar
Why did you run away or was it home that ran away from you? You said that you would stay.
So where do you belong when things start to change? We can't choose
where we've come from, but we can choose where we go from here.
```

It's been a trip. 

```bazaar
Stop calling me out,
We’re never going to put the pieces back together if you won’t let me get better.
Stop digging it up,
Or we’re never gonna see it all in bloom.

Thinking back upon those days,
Way, way back when I was young,
I was such a little shit,
I was always on the run.
Well you know just what they say
“Just like father then like son”
Don’t delude me with your sympathy,
I can do this on my own.
```

Identity solace
just like father then like son - in bloom
fade in fade out
two way mirror
