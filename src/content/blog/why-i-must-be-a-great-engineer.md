  I don't owe anything to anyone... or do I?
---

It’s not because I love money, though it's good to have.

Or because I love engineering, which I do, but;

It’s because I owe it to my mother.

<hr />

My mom gave up on pursuing physics because of motherhood. If I come into this world, I think she would’ve been one of the very best in her field.

She had the conviction to stick through with it and get a master’s degree;

She stuck through being the only woman in the room;
Constantly having to be aware for her safety,
Navigating people with ulterior motives,
and having her identity being reduced to her gender.

So when I am birthed with the advantage of a better environment, gifted with the curiosity that she has always had;
Anything less than absolute excellence, is a failure.

April 12th, 2001;
I don't think she lost her spark that day;
She passed it on to me.

I bear her torch.

It’s a privilege to be her legate.

Soon, my reputation should precede me.
